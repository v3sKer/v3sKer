### **About me:**

Hello! My name is Daniil, but people in Internet know me as v3sKer!<br>
My dream was, is and wiil be to become a real cybersport player in CS. I feel like I can do that, and that I have enough "talent" and skill<br> 
but, unfortunatelly I don't have enough time and perseverance to start a real cybersport career.<br>
<br>
I am very interested in IT industy, because of my parents which were one of the largest Internet providers in Chisinau, our country capital.<br>
Several time ago I learned my first programming language - C#. But, before that I was administrating a Minecraft server named NPServers.<br>
Now, I have my project [Minetopia.tech](https://minetopia.tech), which is a Minecraft SMP. We have big benefits over other similar servers.<br>
Also, I love to play different games, starting from MMoRPGs, ending with Sandboxes and Shooters.<br>
